# Software Bug Predcition

Software Bug Predicton using machine learning algorithms.

# Introduction
Software bug is one of the major issues in a computer industry. \
It is always desirable to have minimum software bug and software system to reach at the maximum accuracy level.  \
Machine learning can plays a very important role in software bug prediction.

We have used various classifier for this.

# Running instruction:
 - Upload the project into google colab
 - Take all the dataset(link given below and also in google colab file) and set the location of the dataset in the colab and run.
## Libraries Used

- sklearn
- pandas
- numpy

## Classifier Used
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- KNeighborsClassfier Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Booster
- Naive Bayes


## DataSet

 - [All DataSet Used is here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IFdXSOE3kVxMRsbNIqu3Z5FBsQ8gKRHy?usp=drive_link)
 


## Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is important beacause if the numbers of independent variables are more than optimal than machine learning algorithm show a decrease of accuracy as well as it becomes complex.
 - We have taken top 5 Feature
 - Then again evaluated the model.
#### Evalation done on
 - Within Dataset
 - Mix Dataset
 - Cross Dataset
## Evaluation of model

Various performance metrics to evaluate perforamnce namely:
 - Accuracy
 - F1 Score
 - Precision
 - Recall
 - Confusion Matrix




## Domain Filter

### Various Domain Filters which are used :
 - Brauakfilter
 - Data Selection
 - DSBG
 - DTB
 - Peterfilter
 - TCA
 - Universal
